===========

currentcost is a small Python-based suite (daemon and library) for interfacing
with a CurrentCost CC-128 meter. It provides facilities for obtaining the XML
data stream from the meter and converting it to a variety of database formats
(CSV and XML files for loading, or SQLite direct output currently).

The project is written in `Python`_ and is open-sourced under the GPL license.
The `source code`_ can be obtained from GitHub. The `documentation`_ can be
read on ReadTheDocs.
